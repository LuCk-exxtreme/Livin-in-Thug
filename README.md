# Livin-in-Thug
My bot Livin' in Thug version 1 repo.

# ⚠️ Cautions
You can fork the project but you need to take care of following:
1. I've made changes to the index.js in order to not leak any private things in there.
2. Some changes needs you to enter info about your bot so look out for those changes since I've not mentioned where you need to channel here.

# Top.gg data for your bot
The following guide is for how to set up vote reward only as it is hard.
1.You'll require an additional bot which is 24/7 online or atleast as long as your bot and the packages are same, a channel where the voterID is sent.
2.Now go to top.gg and in edit section add the port and ip of your second bot, it should look like: http://your.server.ip:port/dblwebhook
always remember it is http not https here.
3.You will need to copy the code of the file : top.gg vote.js
and add the full code with changes except where told to in your second bot.
4.Now test the webhook, if any problems occur you can join my server and ask me : https://discord.gg/FSMTeH3hse.
